Mod information
=======
This is a backport of [1foxy2 mod](https://github.com/1foxy2/xaero-train-map) that draws Create mod's train tracks onto Xaero's World Map just like you see in Journey Map mod.

This backport works on Xaero's World Map 1.40+, which changed some internals making the original mod and other backports (the ones I know) not work with the latest versions.

The mod was tested and **is working** with:
- Minecraft 1.20.1
- Forge 4.7.30
- Create 6.0.6
- Xaero's World Map 1.40.11

Note: other versions _might_ work, as long as Xaero's World Map is version 1.40+. I tested with Create 6.0.8 and it just crashes my game, independently of this mod or other Xaero's mods. There's a rendering bug somewhere when I get near a train. Version 6.0.6 is fine on my end.

Credits
=======
- Thanks to 1foxy2 for the original mod.
- Thanks to Zhincore for the [Xaero's World Map 1.39.9 compatible backport](https://github.com/Zhincore/xaero-train-map-1-20) used as a guide.

Q&A
=======
* **Do I need to add this to the server?**
  * No, this is client-only mod.
* **I don't code! Where's the JAR file?**
  * Look to the right in this webpage. There should be a Releases section.
* **I have installed the mod, but I don't see the train tracks in the World Map!**
  * Look at the left-top corner. There should be a new toggle button that you can use to enable or disable the train tracks.
* **Can I change the train tracks color?**
  * Yes. In Create mod's client settings there's a menu for the Train and there you can change them. There's only white, gray and red at the moment.
* **Will this also work on Xaero's Mini map?**
  * No, you won't see the train tracks on the mini-map.
* **Is it compatible with mod XYZ?**
  * You'll have to test that.
* **Can I add this to my modpack?**
  * Sure, don't forget to give credit though.
* **Is there a Fabric version?**
  * I don't know. I don't play with Fabric (yet).

Future Plans
=======
##### This might or might not happen. Depends on if there's demand and if I have the free time to do it.
1. [ ] Fix possible bugs.
2. [ ] Support Minecraft 1.21.1 like the original mod for recent Xaero's World Map versions.
3. [ ] Support other versions of Minecraft if there's demand for it (but only recent versions).
4. [ ] Publish the mod somewhere if 1foxy2 permits.
